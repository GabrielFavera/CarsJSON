## About this Project
My first job totally done in flutter using a JSON to show data on screen..

## The idea of the App is:
Train the use of JSON, creating a dart file from the JSON, and the use of data between different screens.

## Why?
With the need to leverage data across screens and consume it from a JSON file I learned a lot.

Also, you can use this Project as you wish, be for study, be for make improvements or earn money with it!

It's free!

You can send how many codes do you want, I'll be glad to analyse them! And if you have any question about the project...
